From a single cell perspective, she uses an integrated proteomics tool (called INSIGHT) and is interested in developing new tools to advance the in vivo mapping of signaling networks that govern brain and cancer biology, to enable single-cell spatial phosphoproteomics by mass spectrometry. Her talk is part of a recruitment initiative for single cell neurobiology (made possible by the Ludmer), and the title of her talk is “Decoding Signaling Networks at the Brain Tumor-Host Interface”. It will be an excellent presentation by a rising star in our field!",

      "details": "Cell and tissue functions arise from the coordinated activities of thousands of different genes. Understanding these functions requires imaging at the genome scale, which advances knowledge in many areas of biology, from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and the organization of cell types in complex tissues. A single-cell genome-scale imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), was developed to enable spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, 3D-genomics, and functional genomics. This method allows for single-cell gene-expression profiling in intact tissues, facilitating the identification, spatial mapping, and functional investigation of distinct cell types within those tissues. Using this approach, molecularly defined, spatially resolved, and functionally annotated cell atlases of the brain have been created. This lecture will describe the MERFISH technology and its applications, with a particular focus on mapping the molecular, spatial, and functional organizations of distinct cell types in the brain.",
